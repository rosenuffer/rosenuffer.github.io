    <h1> About Us
    </h1>
    <h2> Nice to meet you </h2>

    <p> Hi. We are Rose Nuffer and Violet Lovely-Lopez. We created this project during the Summer Immersion Program at Girls Who Code. We liked to make this website because those with disabilities live in a world built for the abled. We think everyone should be able to participate in activities without being excluded</p>
    <p> And one more thing to take away before you go, barriers people with disabilities face begin with people's attitudes â€” attitudes often rooted in misconseptions about what it's like to live with a disability.</p>

      <p id="myth">Myth 12: People with disabilities always need help.
Fact: Many people with disabilities are independent and capable of giving help. If you would like to help someone with a disability, ask if he or she needs it before you act.</p>
