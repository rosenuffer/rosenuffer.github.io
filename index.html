      <h1>Disability Rights</h1>
      <p>The problem we are addressing is that people with disabilities face many barriers and lack of accessibility which keep them from being included in day to day life. </p>

      <p>Those with disabilities are forced to operate in a world that isnâ€™t built in a way that allows them to function.
      They are discriminated against in both physical and virtual spaces
      The way our country and society treat those with disabilities is unfair, and it's important to know how to help. The purpose of this site is to provide information to both people with disabilites seeking help and those seeking to help them. 
</p>
      <p>We want you to learn to be aware of the challenges people with disabilities face and what you can do to help and create a lasting change. </p>
